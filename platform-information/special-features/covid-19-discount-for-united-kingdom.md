### Go Live

You can now save the promotion to make it live.

### How to disable promotion

Turning off the COVID-19 promotion is very simple.  Simply open the promotion, check the disable promotion setting.  Alternatively you can delete the promotion from the promotions menu \(Settings &gt; System &gt; Promo Codes &gt; Delete\) by hitting the trash can button on the right-hand side of the promotion in question.
