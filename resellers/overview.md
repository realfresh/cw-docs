# Overview

With a reseller account, you will get access to your own white-labelled and customized online admin interface hosted under your own domain. Any customer accounts created through this admin interface will be tagged under your main reseller account. These accounts are not tied into the CloudWaitress billing system at all and they will not receive any marketing e-mail from us. While you manage the billing of your customers, we will only bill you.

## What's Included

### Online Admin Interface

The online admin interface we provide is the exact same as the one found on our website at [https://admin.cloudwaitress.com](https://admin.cloudwaitress.com), but as stated it is modified to your business and any references to CloudWaitress are stripped out. Any customer accounts created through your admin portal will be tagged as part of your reseller account. This admin interface is also where your customers will go to manage their account information and orders. This can be hosted at any domain name of your choice.

### Custom Domain Name Integration

Under CloudWaitress, all new accounts can select a subdomain name under the main 'cloudwaitress.com' domain. As part of your reseller account, all online stores created will instead be assigned a sub-domain under your custom domain name.

### Comprehensive Support

All our resellers can attest to the level of commitment we put into supporting them and their customers. We work very closely with them and see to it that they always get the support required. We also regularly take new feature requests.

### Access To All Platform Updates

Every update and fix that we release will be automatically added to your configuration and sites so you will always have the most up to date system.

### Personalized System Customizations

Here are some of the things we can customize for you:

* Login / signup logo
* Application name
* Disable website sign up’s
* Auto-verify email addresses
* Pre-set store design & settings
* Custom chat widget integration

## Pricing

We only charge a low flat monthly cost per restaurant. Please get in touch with us to find out the exact amount. There are no other fees involved.

## Requirements

### Domain Name

You will need your own domain name to set up a reseller account. A domain name is used to host your admin dashboard application and your customer's online stores.

For example, the admin interface can be located at "admin.example.com". All your online stores can be found at "\(name\).example.com". Optionally, a separate custom domain can be connected to your individual online stores.

### Support E-mail Address

We require one support email address to white-label all support and system emails sent to customers. This includes order notification e-mails. If this is not provided, your customers will receive emails from "support@cloudwaitress.com ".

Please note, Gmail, Hotmail and other e-mail hosting providers will not work for this. A custom domain email address is mandatory.

### Billing System \(Optional\)

You will need a way to bill your clients as their subscription is not managed by us. Consider using software such as [https://www.chargebee.com](https://www.chargebee.com). We provide an integration with them for resellers to automate client billing.  Please note that extra fees and charges apply.

## Setup Process

On average, it takes 2 days to complete the reseller account set up once we have gotten all the information required from you. Here are the steps involved:

1. Contact us and we will send you the online reseller sign up form
2. Complete the form to start the process
3. We will request your billing information along with the initial deposit.
4. Once the deposit is confirmed, we will configure your reseller account 
5. We will provide you with the necessary details to configure your web domain and to set up the platform
6. After this, you can review your setup, create a demo account and make any post set up modifications

## FAQ

#### Difference between standard accounts and accounts created under your reseller system

Reseller customer accounts do not have any subscription with CloudWaitress. This means they do not receive any bills, invoices or charges from us.

Reseller customer accounts are not tied into our mailing systems meaning they do not receive any marketing/help emails from us.

#### What should I charge my customers?

We want to have a mutually beneficial relationship with our resellers. We see our role as being able to provide a reliable and robust online ordering system that is always being improved. The role of the reseller lies in the implementation and packaging of the system for businesses.

To avoid the issue of your clients potentially being upset at a difference in pricing from resellers and CloudWaitress itself, it's best to take a value-added pricing approach. What this means is to find ways to add value on top of the bare online ordering system. For example, you can offer packages that include system setup, facebook ad designs, printers, staff training, ongoing support and much more.
