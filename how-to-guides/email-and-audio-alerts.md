### Setting up Email Notifications

Email notifications keep you informed about orders and store activities even when you're not logged into your dashboard.

1. **Verify Your Email Address**
   * Ensure the Primary Email Address field is accurate. This is where order receipts and notifications will be sent.
2. **Configure Report Emails**
   * Add up to 4 additional email addresses under Report Emails for daily, weekly, or monthly summaries of orders and sales performance.
   * Ideal for owners, managers, or team leads who need regular performance updates.
3. **Select Events for Email Alerts**
   * You can enable or disable alerts for:
     * New Orders – Get notified when a customer places an order.
     * New Bookings – For table reservations (if dine-in is enabled).
     * Age Verification Requests – If your store sells age-restricted products.
4. **PDF Order Receipts**
   * Each order email includes a PDF copy of the receipt for easy printing or reference.

Click Save to apply your email settings.

### Configuring Audio Notications

Audio alerts help your team stay responsive to real-time events, especially during busy hours.

1. **Choose an Alert Sound**
   * Select from the available list of alert tones.
   * Click Test Sound to preview it. Make sure your browser has sound enabled and your device volume is up.
2. **Set Repeat Count**
   * Control how many times the sound plays per alert (e.g., repeat 3 times for emphasis).
3. **Enable Stop On Click**
   * Turn this on if you want the sound to stop immediately when someone clicks the screen (useful for fast acknowledgment).
4. **Enable Audio Alerts For:**
   * New Orders
   * Bookings (if applicable)
   * Age Verification Requests

Click Save to activate your audio settings.

### Testing Your Notifications
