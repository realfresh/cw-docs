# Changing Bank Account / Debit Card Details Associated with an Express Account

To update bank account details, an Express user should head to the **Account Tab** in their Dashboar&#x64;**.** Under **Payout Details**, they will see the platforms tied to their account. Once a platform is selected, they will be able to update:

* Where to send their payouts (debit card or bank account)
* Their bank account or card details

If the external account (debit card or bank account) in question has previously received a successful payout, **Express** users will be required to enter their previous external bank account details and a 6-digit SMS verification code to make any edits.

**Note** that keeping payout details up to date helps to prevent any delay in receiving payouts. To avoid delays, we strongly encourage **Express** users to update their payout information in advance of any changes and to update their debit card details before the card expires.
