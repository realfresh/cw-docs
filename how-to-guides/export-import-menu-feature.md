# Export/Import Menu Feature

\
Here's a video on how this feature works:

### Steps:

#### 1.  Log in to your dashboard. Once you're logged in, navigate to the 'Staff Account' section.

* It's important to ensure that the 'Import/Export' feature is enabled when creating a staff account. If this feature isn't toggled on, the store won’t have access to import or export menus.&#x20;

2. Head over to ‘Restaurants’ then ‘Manage’ and click on 'Menus'. New buttons for CSV import and export will be visible. These let you import or export your menu manually in CSV format.

### Exporting

Let’s take a look at how exporting works. For example, we have two menus: 'Pizza Menu' and 'Pizza Menu 3'. When we select 'CSV Export', it will download the menu file in a CSV format.

In the exported CSV file, you'll find the following colums:\
\- Menu Name\
\- Category Name\
\- Dish Name

* Menu Name
* Category Name
* Dish Name
* Dish Price
* Dish Type
* Dish Description

Meanwhile, you don't need to enter anything in the Menu ID, Category ID, or Dish ID. You may delete the details in these columns.

### Importing

Let’s see how importing works. Suppose someone accidentally deletes a menu. You can retrieve it by importing the CSV file you exported earlier.

* After typing "import", select the CSV file you want to retrieve, and within a few seconds, the menu will be uploaded back into the system

Please also note that the option sets of the menu you exported will not be included when you import the file. You will need to manually recreate the option sets and item tags in your menu.
