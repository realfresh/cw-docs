As we use websites, applications, and online services, we are continuously sharing information, from our names and emails to our browsing patterns and location data. This is where the **Privacy Policy** comes in. It is an essential document that describes exactly how a company uses your personal information.

To Set up **Privacy Policy**, go to Settings > System > Privacy Policy > Save.&#x20;
