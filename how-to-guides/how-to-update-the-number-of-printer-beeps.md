# How to Update the Number of Printer Beeps

If your printer has a buzzer, you can set the number of beeps it should make after printing. Adjusting your printer’s beep settings makes it easier to notice new orders, especially during busy periods, ensuring that no print order goes unnoticed.

By increasing or customizing the number of beeps, you can better manage high-volume times and improve workflow efficiency. This helps your staff respond quickly to incoming orders, reduces the chance of missed tickets, and keeps your kitchen or store running smoothly.
