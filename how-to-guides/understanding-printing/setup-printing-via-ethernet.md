# Setup Printing Via Ethernet

### Steps

1. Physically connect the printer to the network using an Ethernet cable and power it on.
   * On the printer, perform a **self-test / network configuration** print (usually from the printer’s menu).
   * **Write down the printer’s IP address** shown on that printout.
2. On your Windows device open **Control Panel**

4. Click **"Add a printer"**
5. When Windows searches, choose **“The printer that I want isn’t listed.”**
6. In the popup select **“Add a printer using a TCP/IP address or hostname”** and click **Next**.
7. Change **Device type** to **TCP/IP Device**.
8. In **Hostname or IP address** enter the IP address you got from the self-test print. Click **Next**.
9. When prompted for the device driver, choose **Standard** → **Generic Network Card** (or if a specific driver for your model is available, you can install that instead). Click **Next**.
10. On the next screen choose **Manufacturer: Generic** and **Printers: Generic / Text Only**. Click **Next**.

11. If prompted about replacing drivers, choose **Replace the current driver** (or install driver if needed). Click **Next**.
12. Update the **Printer name** to a friendly name (e.g., `Office Printer - Kitchen`) and click **Next**.
