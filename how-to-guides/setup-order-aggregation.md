# Setup Order Aggregation

Order aggregation allows you to consolidate orders from multiple delivery platforms, such as UberEats and DoorDash, directly into CloudWaitress. This centralizes order management, reduces errors, and streamlines kitchen workflow by eliminating the need to switch between apps.

### Setup Process:

1. Contact us via live chat to let us know you’d like to start the aggregation setup.
2. We will request your credentials for platforms like UberEats, DoorDash, etc.
3. Our team will reach out to you for verification to fully activate aggregation on the third-party platforms.
4. Once the setup is complete, we will notify you and your CloudWaitress system will begin receiving orders from all connected platforms.
