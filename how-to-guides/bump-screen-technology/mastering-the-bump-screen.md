### Accessing the Bump Screen

1. Log in to your admin dashboard.
2. Click the Order icon, then select Bump Screen.

> 📌 Note: Only orders in _Confirmed_ status will appear on the Bump Screen.

### Understanding the Order View

Each order on the Bump Screen displays:

* Service type (Pickup, Dine-In, or Delivery)
* Estimated time for prep
* Number of items in the order

### Updating Dish and Order Statuses&#x20;

* Click on each dish once it’s prepared to mark it as complete.
* To take further actions, click the three dots next to the “Ready” button. From there, you can:
  * Change the order status
  * Add time to the estimated pickup time
  * Print the order

When all items are ready, click Ready. The order will move to the _Ready_ section and be removed from the bump screen, keeping your view clean and focused.

### Customizing Your View

* Click the View icon to toggle between Desktop View and Tablet View.
* Adjust the number of rows and layout to suit your kitchen’s needs.

### Filtering Orders

To filter orders by service type:

1. Click the Filter icon next to the View icon.
2. Choose to view only _Delivery_, _Pickup_, or _Dine-In_ orders.



With the Bump Screen, you can manage your kitchen more efficiently, reduce errors, and streamline your workflow.
