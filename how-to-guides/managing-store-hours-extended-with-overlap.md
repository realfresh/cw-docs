# Managing Store Hours: Extended with Overlap

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/CkxdQi8x87Y" %}

### How to Set Regular Store Hours

1. From your dashboard, go to Settings > Locations > Operating.
2. For standard store hours (e.g., 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM), set:
   * Start Time: `09:00`
   * End Time: `21:00`
   * Remember, the system uses 24-hour format (e.g., 21:00 = 9:00 PM).
3. Repeat this for each weekday your store operates.

### How to Set Overnight or Overlapping Store Hours

If your store runs past midnight (e.g., 9:00 AM to 3:00 AM), you need two separate time slots to cover the operating period.

Example:

* Saturday (Day Slot): Start: `09:00` End: `23:59`
* Sunday (Midnight Slot): Start: `00:00` End: `03:00`

Repeat this process for each day with overlapping hours (e.g., Friday–Saturday, Saturday–Sunday).

### Adding Multiple Store Hours in One Day

You can add multiple store hours within the same day. For example:

* Lunch Hours: 09:00–14:00
* Dinner Hours: 17:00–23:00

To add another set of store hours:

* Click Add Time Slot
* Enter the additional start and end times.

### Verifying Your Store Hours

Once saved:

* Open your store’s front-end ordering page.
* Confirm that the displayed hours match your operating schedule.
* Ensure overlapping schedules appear correctly (e.g., customers can order past midnight).
