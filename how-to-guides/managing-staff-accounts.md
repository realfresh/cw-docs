# Managing Staff Accounts



{% embed url="https://youtu.be/HV6l_iRTSkU" %}

\


Having a staff account is crucial for several reasons:

* **Access Control**: Ensures that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive information and systems.
* **Resource Allocation**: Helps in assigning and tracking resources efficiently among staff members.
* **Security**: Enhances security by enabling activity monitoring and auditing

&#x20;      4, Enter the staff member's **email** and **password**

&#x20;      5\. Choose the **restaurant location** (for multi-branch setups)

### 2. Assign a Role

Use **Restriction Presets** to quickly assign common roles

* **Manager -** full access
* **Front Staff** - limited to order views and bookings
* **Kitchen** - access to kitchen screens only
* **Driver** - for delivery staff
* **Menu Manager** - for users managing items and menus

### 3. Customize Permissions

Start with a preset, then adjust:

* **Menu Editor**
* **Reports**
* **Customer Info (view only / edit)**
* **Store Pages**

You can fine-tune permissions down to whether users can view, edit, or delete data.&#x20;

### 4. Save and Share Login Details

Once configured, click **Save.** Share the login credentials with the staff member. They'll only see what they're allowed to access - no more, no less.&#x20;
