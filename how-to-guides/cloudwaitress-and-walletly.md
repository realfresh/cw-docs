When you visit the CW store website, you have two options to place your order: either proceed as a guest, or sign up as a customer. If you choose to place an order as a guest, you won't need to create an account on the website. However, signing up as a customer allows you to save your personal information, payment details, and order history for future use.\

To place an order as a guest, simply select the "Guest" option on the website's homepage, and follow the instructions to place your order. Alternatively, if you prefer to sign up as a customer, select the "Sign Up" option on the homepage and follow the instructions to create an account. Once you have an account, you can place your order by selecting the desired items and adding them to your cart.

To ensure your order is successful, make sure your order amount exceeds $100 and select "cash" as your payment type. This will ensure a smooth transaction when your order is delivered.
