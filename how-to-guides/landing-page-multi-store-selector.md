# Landing Page Multi Store Selector

It improves order accuracy, reduces confusion, and ensures customers are connected to the correct branch or delivery zone.



### How it Works

**Landing Page Access**

* When visiting the restaurant’s landing page, customers will see an Order Online button.
* For single-store setups, this button takes them directly to the ordering page.

**Location Detection**

* For multiple stores, the website prompts customers to allow location access.
* Allowing location detection ensures the system identifies the nearest branch capable of fulfilling the order.
* If a customer declines, they can manually enter their address.

**Store Selection**

* Once the location is detected or the address is entered, the system displays a list of stores serving that area.
* Customers can review and select the branch closest to them or their preferred location.

**Menu Access**

* Selecting a store directs the customer to that branch’s menu page.
* Customers can browse items and start their order immediately.

**Benefits**

* Ensures orders are sent to the correct store.
* Improves customer experience by simplifying the selection process.
* Supports multiple-store operations and delivery areas efficiently.
