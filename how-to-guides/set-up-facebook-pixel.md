* Add To Cart
* Complete Registration
* Initiate Checkout
* Page View
* Purchase
* Schedule (Table Booking)
* View Content

### Steps:

### How to get the Facebook Pixel ID

You can get your Facebook Pixel ID directly from the Meta Events Manager (formerly known as the Facebook Ads Manager).

Here is the step-by-step process:

#### Step 1: Access Meta Events Manager

1. Go to your Facebook/Meta Business Settings or your Ads Manager.
2. Navigate to the Events Manager.
   * _Tip: You can usually find this in the left-hand navigation menu under "Data Sources" or "Measure & Report."_

#### Step 2: Find Your Pixel ID

1. In the Events Manager dashboard, look for the list of your data sources.
2. If you already have a Pixel created:
   * Click on the Pixel name you want to use.
   * The Pixel ID will be prominently displayed at the top of the page, usually right below the Pixel's name. It is a long string of numbers (e.g., `1234567890123456`).

#### Step 3: If You Don't Have a Pixel

If you don't see any Pixels listed, you'll need to create one first:

1. Click the green "Connect Data Sources" or "Add New Data Source" button (usually a green plus sign).
2. Select "Web".
3. Choose "Facebook Pixel" (or "Meta Pixel" in newer interfaces).
4. Follow the prompts to name your Pixel and enter your website URL. Meta will then generate the Pixel ID for you, and it will appear on the setup screen.
