### Step1: Enable Pre-Orders for Your Menu

1. Log in to [CloudWaitress](https://cloudwaitress.com/)  and navigate to your **Dashboard.**
2. Go to the **Menu** section and select the menu for which you want to enable pre-orders.
3. Scroll down to the **Pre-Order Settings** and toggle the option to **Enable Pre-Orders**.
4. Define how many days in advance customers can place pre-orders by configuring the **Pre-Order Cut-Off Time**. This will help prevent last-minute orders.

> **Note:** Be sure to click Save after configuring your settings.

### Step 2: Adjust Service Options for Pickup, Delivery, and Dine-in

1. Go to **Settings** > **Services** in your dashboard.
2. Ensure that pre-orders are supported for all service types (Pickup, Delivery, and Dine-In).
3. For each service, click to edit and then go to **Order Timing.**
4. Scroll down to enable **Later Orders**, and define which days and hours pre-orders can be accepted.
5. Set up **Time Intervals** to allow customers to choose their preferred pickup or delivery time.

> **Pro Tip**: Use the Order Offset feature to ensure your team has enough time to prepare orders before the scheduled pickup or delivery time.

### Step 3: Manage High Demand with Order Limits

1. In the **Order Timing** section, configure **Limit Orders Per Time Interval** to control the number of pre-orders accepted within specific time slots. This is especially useful during peak hours or special events when you want to manage demand effectively.

> **Remember**: Once you’ve made all the changes, click Save to apply the settings.

### Step 4: Test Your Pre-Order Setup

1. Visit your **Online Store** and place a test pre-order to verify that everything is working correctly.
2. Ensure customers can select the date and time based on your pre-order settings.\
