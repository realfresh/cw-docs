# Setup PayPal Payments

PayPal is one of the most widely used online payment methods. munchhouses.co.uk makes use of PayPal's REST express checkout payment integration. This allows us to process payments on your behalf with the funds going straight to your account. Please be aware that PayPal is only available in certain countries and currencies. You can see them [here](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/direct/rest-api-payment-country-currency-support/).

{% hint style="danger" %}
We highly recommend using Stripe instead of PayPal for online payments. PayPal occasionally has various service issues in our experience. See how Stripe payments guide instead below.

## How PayPal Payments Work

Once PayPal is enabled, the option will be available to customers during the checkout phase of their order. Upon selection, they can either log in to their PayPal account, create an account or use their credit card and check out as a guest in order to complete payment.

## Requirements

In order to use PayPal with CloudWaitress, you will need a **fully valid business account**. If you already have a PayPal business account, you can skip this step.

If you do not already have one, sign up at [https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/account-selection](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/account-selection). You can also upgrade your personal account to a business one from within your account settings.

## Connecting Your PayPal Account

### Create a REST API Application

1. Visit [https://developer.paypal.com/developer/applications/](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/applications/)
2. Log into your PayPal account using the login in button
3. Once logged in, scroll down until you see the title "REST API apps"
4. Press the "Create App" button

## PayPal's Fees

Please be aware that using PayPal, like other online credit card processors, you will be charged a fee on every transaction. This has to be managed by yourself through your own PayPal account as we are not responsible for this. You can use the PayPal website to see the fees for your respective country and currency.

## Refunds

Currently, refunds must be manually processed from within your PayPal account.
