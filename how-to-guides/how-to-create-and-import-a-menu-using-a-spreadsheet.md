### Steps:

1. Log in to your dashboard. Once you're logged in, navigate to the 'Staff Account' section

* It's important to ensure that the 'Import/Export' feature is enabled when creating a staff account. If this feature isn't toggled on, the store won’t have access to import or export menus.&#x20;

2\.  Go to your dashboard's "Menus" section. Here, you have the option of using one of the provided templates or creating a custom menu.\
\
\- You will see the list of menus, categories, and dish names when the initial menu has been created. Option sets will also be generated.&#x20;

3.  To edit your menu in a spreadsheet. Click the 'CSV Export' option to extract the menu data. The exported CSV file will contain several columns that you need to fill in with the correct information. \
    \
    \- The important coumns to fill out are as follows:

    * Menu Name
    * Category Name
    * Dish Name
    * Dish Type (Standard or Combo)
    * Dish Description\


    <mark style="color:red;">Note:</mark>  You can delete the Menu ID, Category ID, and Dish ID. These can be deleted as they are not required for editing.

    \
    4\. Begin adding your new menu data. Once completed, save the file in CSV format. \
    \
    5\. After saving the new menu on the spreadsheet, you can now return to the menus and erase the original /current menu generated previously. \
    \
    6\. Then Import  the updated CSV file into your ordering site by clicking the "CSV Import" button.

    * Once the import is successful, the dishes will be created based on the information you entered in the spreadsheet.\


    <mark style="color:red;">Note:</mark> Option sets and tags are not included in the CSV file. After completing the export and import process, you’ll need to manually create the option sets and link them to each dish.\
