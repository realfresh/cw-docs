# Make Menu Available for Logged-in Customers Only

With this feature, your menu is visible only to customers who are logged in. It’s perfect for offering exclusive access to VIPs, loyalty members, or special customer groups. You can showcase premium items, limited-time offers, or special pricing without exposing them to the general public. This not only helps you reward loyal customers but also gives you control over who can see and order certain items, creating a more personalized and secure ordering experience.

### Steps:

1. On your admin dashboard, go to **Settings** > **System**
