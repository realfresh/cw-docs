It includes three different views, each tailored for different use cases:

### Accessing the Order Dashboard

* Go to your admin dashboard.
* Click Orders from the left-hand menu to access the dashboard.

### Dashboard Views

**1. Board View (Recommended for Real-Time Management)**

* Real-time updates: No need to refresh the page.
* Orders move left to right across status columns.
* The icon on the left of each order indicates the service type (Pickup, Delivery, Dine-in).
* Color coding shows the current order status at a glance.
* Click on any order to:
  * View details
  * Change the order status
  * Modify estimated ready time
  * Take additional actions

* Zoom in/out for better readability
* Toggle unconfirmed orders visibility
* Adjust quick service settings for each service type

**2. List View (Ideal for Searching & Reporting)**

* Displays the latest 10, 25, or 50 orders.
* Not ideal for active order tracking, but perfect for:
  * Searching for specific orders
  * Filtering by customer, date, or service type
  * Exporting data for reports

Use filters to quickly find and manage individual orders.

**3. Bump Screen View (For Kitchen Staff)**

* A Digital Kitchen Display System (KDS) for efficient back-of-house operations.
* Designed to help kitchen teams manage order preparation and timing.
* (Check out our dedicated Bump Screen tutorial for full details.)

#### <mark style="color:red;">Pro Tips</mark>
