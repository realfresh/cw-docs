# Hardware Requirements

## Stable Internet Connection

Every aspect of the system runs online and therefore requires you to be connected to the internet to receive orders. Here are a few recommendations about how to set up your internet:

* Use your own internet connection instead of a shared connection so you have greater control
* Keep a 3G / 4G mobile internet connection as a backup in-case there is an interruption with your normal connection. Consider using your phone on hotspot mode for such instances.
* Consider exclusively using a 3G / 4G mobile internet connection. Certain countries have a much more reliable mobile network such as the UK

IT staff occasionally set up an internet firewall for small business to prevent accessing harmful content. Ensure that cloudwaitress.com is white-listed on your firewall to avoid connection issues to our servers.
{% endhint %}

## Computer or Tablet

To manage your online store and orders, you will need a device that can access the internet. At a minimum, we recommend using a tablet or bigger. Phone access is possible but maybe limiting.

## Printer

This is optional but very helpful for managing orders

You can automatically or manually print new orders using any printer whose drivers are installed on an Android device, Windows or Linux PC. To clarify, this means if you can print from an application like Word or Notepad, then it's compatible with our service. We highly recommend using a thermal receipt printer.

Compatible devices:

* Android 1.5, 1.6, 2, 3, 4
* Windows - 7, 8, 10
* Linux - requires NodeJS

## Recommended Computers & Tablets

We highly recommend using an Android device or Windows 10 tablet/computer. Windows provides the greatest flexibility and allows for wireless order printing whilst being able to use the order and table booking dashboard.

### Worldwide

Windows 10 tablets are abundant and cheap these days. You can't go wrong choosing from one of the major brands. Some notable brands include:

* Lenevo
* ASUS
* HP
* Microsoft - Surface Pro Tablet
* Chuwi - Decent Chinese brand, starting from around Â£200

## Recommended Printers

You can use any printer with Windows or Linux drivers or any printer that works with ESCPOS using Android, so you are not restricted to just the printers we recommend.

### Branded Printers
